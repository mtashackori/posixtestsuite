Errors that caused by feature missing

timers:
   _SC_CPUTIME  (freebsd, 200112L set to be, _POSIX_CPUTIME)
   _SC_THREAD_CPUTIME (freebsd, 200112L set to be, _POSIX_THREAD_CPUTIME)  
   _SC_DELAYTIMER_MAX (freebsd, called from sysctl)

scheduler:
    SCHED_SPORADIC (linux)

signals:
    SIGPOLL (freebsd)
    SIGRTMIN (done, should wait for realtime signals to be done)
    SIGRTMAX (done, should wait for realtime signals to be done) 
    _SC_REALTIME_SIGNALS (freebsd, called from sysctl?)
    _SC_SIGQUEUE_MAX  (freebsd, called from sysctl?)  
    bsd_signal (waiting for compiling results)

semaphore 
    _SC_SEM_NSEMS_MAX  (done, but needs kernel to fail allocate more)

    posix_typed_mem_open (linux)

pthreads: 
   pthread_condattr_getclock (done, need to send for review)

Errors that caused by usage (build with -D_NETBSD_SOURCE -lpthread -lrt -lm and disable compiler warnings and use current) 
struct rlimit (inlcude sys/resource.h)
setpgrp (netbsd needs to pass 2 parameters, but other systems, like like linux does not)
struct sigaction sa (include signal.h)
sigfillset(&sa.sa_mask) (include signal.h)
sigaction(include signal.h) 
SIGBUS (include signal.h)
sigfillset (include signal.h)
SIGSEGV (include signal.h)
PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT (need force the type to be pthread_once_t)
cpu_set_t (netbsd has its own implementation)
CPU_ZERO (netbsd has its own implementation)
CPU_SETSIZE (netbsd has its own implementation)
sched_setaffinity (netbsd has its own implementation)
pthread_setaffinity_np (caused by wrong parameters passed in, convert parameter to be netbsd specific)
features.h (no features.h, actually netbsd does not need this file to be correct, just removed)
SIGNAL (depends on macro which is not defined)
SIG_INVALID (depends on macro which is not defined)
SIGTOTEST  (depends on macro which is not defined)
