Errors that caused by usage (build with -lpthread -lrt -lm and disable compiler warnings and use current) 
struct rlimit (inlcude sys/resource.h)
setpgrp (netbsd needs to pass 2 parameters, but other systems, like like linux does not)
struct sigaction sa (include signal.h)
sigfillset(&sa.sa_mask) (include signal.h)
sigaction(include signal.h) 
SIGBUS (include signal.h)
sigfillset (include signal.h)
SIGSEGV (include signal.h)
PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT (need force the type to be pthread_once_t)
cpu_set_t (netbsd has its own implementation)
CPU_ZERO (netbsd has its own implementation)
CPU_SETSIZE (netbsd has its own implementation)
sched_setaffinity (netbsd has its own implementation)
pthread_setaffinity_np (caused by wrong parameters passed in, convert parameter to be netbsd specific)
features.h (no features.h, actually netbsd does not need this file to be correct, just removed)
SIGNAL (depends on macro which is not defined)
SIG_INVALID (depends on macro which is not defined)
SIGTOTEST  (depends on macro which is not defined)
